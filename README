          --+ Py-PF - Managing OpenBSD's Packet Filter with Python +--


Py-PF is a pure-Python module for managing OpenBSD's Packet Filter. It aims to
add powerful and flexible scripting capabilities to PF, making integration with
third-party software (like IDS, web-based configuration interfaces or custom
management scripts) much easier.

The only prerequisite is Python (2.5 or newer), which is available through
OpenBSD's packages and ports system (see http://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq15.html).


1. Installation notes
---------------------

Once you have downloaded the latest tarball, you just need to perform the
following steps to get the module installed:

  * unpack the tarball:

      $ tar -zxvf py-PF-0.0.4.tar.gz

  * move to the newly created directory:

      $ cd ./py-PF-0.0.4/

  * run the install script (as root) by typing:

      # python setup.py install

This will copy the PF module in the third-party modules directory, typically
/usr/local/lib/python2.x/site-packages/.
