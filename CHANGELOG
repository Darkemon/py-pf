Jul 9, 2011 -- version 0.0.6
    - Added support for packet queueing with ALTQ; three new classes have been
      created (PFAltqCBQ, PFAltqHFSC and PFAltqPriQ), corresponding to the
      schedulers supported by OpenBSD.

Jan 19, 2011 -- version 0.0.5
    - Updated to OpenBSD 4.8; the PF stack has undergone some major changes,
      such as removing the different rule types (nat, rdr, binat ... rules do
      not exist anymore) and introducing 'match' rules.
      This has greatly simplified the PFRuleset class and the PacketFilter
      methods that load/retrieve rules.
    - Various bugs have been corrected
    - All the code has been reviewed and is now Py3k-ready.

Jul 26, 2009 -- version 0.0.4

    - Updated to OpenBSD-current; modifications include the removal of 'scrub'
      rules and making some ioctl() transactional (set loginterface, set hostid,
      set reassemble and set debug).
    - Added addresses to PFTable objects; this should make managing tables much
      more user-friendly.
    - Added the PF_RULESET_TABLE ruleset to PFRuleset; this allows loading
      tables along with the other rules and doesn't require that the 'persist'
      flag be set if the table is not yet referenced by any rule.
    - Added the PacketFilter.set_reassembly() method.
    - Added support for table statistics, by adding the PFTStats object and the
      PacketFilter.get_tstats() and PacketFilter.clear_tstats() methods.


Mar 22, 2009 -- version 0.0.3

    - Added the PFAddr and PFPort classes, representing addresses and ports
      respectively. The PFRuleAddr class is now a simple container for a
      PFAddr/PFPort pair.
    - Added table support trough the PFTable and PFTableAddr classes; the
      apropriate methods for managing tables have been added to the PacketFilter
      class.
    - The PFPoolAddr class has been removed: now addresses in PFPools are
      PFAddr instances.
    - Re-written the PFState class and created the PFStateKey class in
      accordance with the changes to PF's state handling.
    - Added the PFUid and PFGid classes, representing user and group IDs.


Jul 06, 2008 -- version 0.0.2

    - Added support for loading rulesets, by means of the
      PacketFilter.load_ruleset() method
    - Added the possibility to selectively kill states, based on address family,
      transport layer protocol, source and destination addresses and interface
      name, thanks to the PacketFilter.kill_states() method
    - Added the PacketFilter.set_hostid() method, which allows you to set the
      hostid, a numeric value used by pfsync(4) to identify which host created
      state table entries


Apr 26, 2008 -- version 0.0.1
